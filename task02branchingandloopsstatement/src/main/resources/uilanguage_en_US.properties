task.branching.comparison =  If 1 is less than 2 - display the word "yes", otherwise - the word "no"
task.branching.replacement = Integers m, n are given. If the numbers are not equal, then replace each of them with the same number equal to the larger of the original ones, and if they are equal, then replace the numbers with zeros.
task.branching.square = Three real numbers are given. Square those of them whose values non-negative and negative to the fourth power.
task.branching.function = Calculate f(x) function
task.branching.max_min = Find max{min(a, b), min(c, d)}.

task.cycle.numbers = Numbers from 5 to 1
task.cycle.subsequence = The sequence an is constructed as follows: a1 = 1, an = 6 + an-1, for each n> 1 Make a program for finding the product of the first 10 members of this sequence.
task.cycle.function = Real (a) and natural (n) are given. calculate: a (a + 1) ... (a + n-1)
task.cycle.dividers = For each natural number in the range from m to n, output all divisors except one and the number itself. m and n are entered from the keyboard
task.cycle.problem = Given two two-digit numbers A and B. Of these numbers, we made 2 four-digit numbers: the first number was obtained by writing first the number A, then B. To obtain the second number, first wrote down the number B, then A. Find the numbers A and B if it is known that the first a four-digit number is divisible by 99, and the second by 49.
